# Future Improvements & Known Issues

1. **DNS Resolution**: DNS is not working correctly after the PXE download phase.
2. **dnsmasq Splitting**: DHCP and TFTP (on high ports) are not properly split into separate dnsmasq instances.
3. **Download Speed**: Image download speed is currently slow.
4. **Machine Identity**: No per-machine identity or autobuild functionality yet.

*Note: These should be the focus for the next machine build.*
